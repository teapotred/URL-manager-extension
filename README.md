# URL-manager-extension

This extension is to be used to save urls for pages that you were redirected to from jobs sites like LinkedIn or Indeed, instead of having to remember each job name, going to LinkedIn, clicking jobs, choosing saved or looking for your specific job name and then having to get redirected again, then having to log ing, go to the jobs sections or carrers, then finding the one application you sent for the one job position you wanted. Seems like too much hastle that could be saved all in one place, in one extension :)
